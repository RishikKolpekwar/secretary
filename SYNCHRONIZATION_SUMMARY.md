# Data Synchronization Summary

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Centralized State Management in App.jsx

1. **Categories State**
   - Managed at the App level
   - Default categories: Food & Drink, Shopping, Transport, Bills & Utilities, Entertainment, Groceries, Healthcare, Travel, Other
   - Synced with localStorage (`secretary_categories`)
   - Fetched from backend on mount
   - Passed to: Transactions, RecurringExpenses, DashboardView, SettingsPage

2. **Tags State**
   - Managed at the App level
   - Default tags: Business, Personal, Tax Deductible, Reimbursable
   - Synced with localStorage (`secretary_tags`)
   - Fetched from backend on mount
   - Passed to: Transactions, RecurringExpenses, DashboardView, SettingsPage

3. **Preferences State**
   - Managed at the App level
   - Saved in localStorage (`secretary_preferences`)
   - Passed to: SettingsPage

### ✅ Settings Page Integration

The SettingsPage component now:
- Receives categories, tags, and preferences from App.jsx
- Can add, edit, and delete categories
- Can add, edit, and delete tags
- Can add, edit, delete, and reorder preferences
- Updates are immediately reflected across all components
- Fixed infinite loop bug in useEffect

### ✅ Data Persistence

All data is persisted in three ways:
1. **Component State** - Immediate updates across all components
2. **localStorage** - Survives page refresh
3. **Backend Sync** - Categories and tags are fetched from backend on load

### ✅ Component Synchronization

All these components now use the synchronized data:

| Component | Uses Categories | Uses Tags | Uses Preferences |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Transactions | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| RecurringExpenses | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| DashboardView | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| SettingsPage | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## How It Works

### Adding a Category in Settings:
1. User types category name and clicks "Add"
2. SettingsPage calls `onCategoriesUpdate(newCategories)`
3. App.jsx's `setCategories` updates the state
4. useEffect saves to localStorage
5. All components re-render with new category
6. Category is immediately available in Transactions and RecurringExpenses dropdowns

### Adding a Tag in Settings:
1. User types tag name and clicks "Add"
2. SettingsPage calls `onTagsUpdate(newTags)`
3. App.jsx's `setTags` updates the state
4. useEffect saves to localStorage
5. All components re-render with new tag
6. Tag is immediately available for selection in Transactions and RecurringExpenses

### Setting Preferences:
1. User adds financial priority in Settings
2. SettingsPage calls `onPreferencesUpdate(newPreferences)`
3. App.jsx's `setPreferences` updates the state
4. useEffect saves to localStorage
5. Preferences are persisted across sessions

## Backend Endpoints

The following backend endpoints are used:
- `GET /get-categories` - Fetch categories from backend
- `GET /get-tags` - Fetch tags from backend

```
Backend API
    ↓ (on mount)
App.jsx State (categories, tags, preferences)
    ↓ (props)
├── SettingsPage (can modify)
├── Transactions (read-only)
├── RecurringExpenses (read-only)
└── DashboardView (read-only)
    ↓ (on change)
localStorage (persistence)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Add a category in Settings → appears in Transactions filter
- [x] Add a category in Settings → appears in RecurringExpenses category dropdown
- [x] Add a tag in Settings → appears in Transactions
- [x] Add a tag in Settings → appears in RecurringExpenses
- [x] Add a preference in Settings → saved and persists on refresh
- [x] Refresh page → all data persists from localStorage
- [x] No infinite loop errors in console
